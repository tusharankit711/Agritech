      <h3 class="subHeading">Temperature Requirements</h3>
      <h4 class="title">Minimum Temperature  </h4>
      <p class="info">Rice requires a minimum temperature of around 20-25°C for germination and early growth.
      <h4 class="title">Optimum Temperature  </h4>
      <p class="info">Ideal temperatures for rice cultivation range between 25-35°C during the growing season. Temperatures above 35°C can adversely affect yield.

    <div class="container">
      <h3 class="subHeading">Humidity Requirements</h3>
      <h4 class="title">Humidity  </h4>
      <p class="info"> Rice cultivation thrives in high humidity conditions, ideally around 70-80% relative humidity during the growing period. This is crucial for pollination and grain formation.

      <h3 class="subHeading">Rainfall</h3>
      <h4 class="title">Rainfall Areas  </h4>
      <p class="info">Rice is a water-intensive crop and requires substantial rainfall or irrigation.</p>
      <h4 class="title">Rainfed Areas  </h4>
      <p class="info">Typically, 1000-2500 mm of well-distributed rainfall during the growing season is ideal.</p>
      <h4 class="title">Irrigated Areas  </h4>
      <p class="info">In irrigated regions, proper water management is crucial, with periodic flooding and draining of fields.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <h3 class="subHeading">Soil Requirements</h3>
      <h4 class="title">Soil Type  </h4>
      <p class="info">Rice can grow in a variety of soils but thrives best in well-drained soils with high organic content.</p>
      <h4 class="title">pH  </h4>
      <p class="info">The ideal soil pH for rice cultivation ranges between 5.0 and 7.5.</p>
      <h4 class="title">Fertility  </h4>
      <p class="info">Rice requires good soil fertility, especially nitrogen. It's often cultivated in flooded fields where nitrogen fertilizers can be efficiently utilized.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <h3 class="subHeading">Cultivation Practices</h3>
      <h4 class="title">Land Preparation  </h4>
      <p class="info">Fields are plowed and leveled to prepare for flooding.</p>
      <h4 class="title">Sowing  </h4>
      <p class="info">Direct seeding or transplanting of young seedlings is common.</p>
      <h4 class="title">Water Management  </h4>
      <p class="info">Rice is often grown in flooded fields (paddy fields) to control weeds and pests and to ensure sufficient water availability.</p>
      <h4 class="title">Weed Control  </h4>
      <p class="info">Flooded conditions naturally suppress many weeds, but manual or chemical weed control may still be necessary.</p>
      <h4 class="title">Disease and Pest Management  </h4>
      <p class="info">Common pests include stem borers, leaf folders, and diseases like blast and bacterial leaf blight. Integrated pest management strategies are used to control these.
