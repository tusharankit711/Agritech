      <h4 class="title">Sowing Time  </h4>
      <p class="info">
        Wheat is typically sown during the winter season, which is the rabi season in India. The optimal sowing time is between October and December, depending on the region.

      <h3 class="subHeading">Temperature Requirements</h3>
      <h4 class="title">Minimum Temperature  </h4>
      <p class="info">
        Wheat requires a minimum temperature of around 10-15°C for germination.
      </p>
      <h4 class="title">Optimum Temperature  </h4>
      <p class="info">
        The ideal temperature range for wheat growth is 15-25°C during the growing season. Cooler temperatures during early growth stages are beneficial for tillering and grain development.

      <h3 class="subHeading">Rainfall</h3>
      <h4 class="title">Rainfall Requirements</h4>
      <p class="info">
        Wheat requires moderate rainfall or irrigation.
      </p>
      <h4 class="title">Rainfed Areas  </h4>
      <p class="info">
        Generally, 500-750 mm of well-distributed rainfall during the growing season is sufficient.
      </p>
      <h4 class="title">Irrigated Areas  </h4>
      <p class="info">
        Proper irrigation management ensures consistent soil moisture, which is crucial for wheat growth.

      <h3 class="subHeading">Soil Requirements</h3>
      <h4 class="title">Soil Type</h4>
      <p class="info">
        Wheat grows well in well-drained loamy soils with good organic content.
      </p>
      <h4 class="title">Fertility  </h4>
      <p class="info">
        Wheat requires good soil fertility, especially nitrogen and phosphorus. Fertilizer application depends on soil testing and crop requirements.
      </p>
      <h4 class="title">Fertilizers</h4>
      <p class="info">
        Commonly used fertilizers for wheat include nitrogenous fertilizers (urea), phosphatic fertilizers (DAP), and potassic fertilizers (MOP). Nitrogen is particularly important for wheat growth and yield.
      </p>
      <h4 class="title">Pesticides</h4>
      <p class="info">
        Wheat may require pesticides to control pests such as aphids, wheat bugs, and diseases like rusts and smuts. Integrated pest management practices are used to minimize pesticide use and maintain crop health.

      <h3 class="subHeading">Cultivation Practices</h3>
      <h4 class="title">Land Preparation  </h4>
      <p class="info">
        Fields are plowed and harrowed to prepare a fine seedbed.
      </p>
      <h4 class="title">Sowing</h4>
      <p class="info">
        Wheat seeds are usually directly drilled into the soil at the right depth.
      </p>
      <h4 class="title">Water Management</h4>
      <p class="info">
        Proper irrigation scheduling is crucial to maintain soil moisture levels throughout the growing season.
      </p>
      <h4 class="title">Weed Control</h4>
      <p class="info">
        Effective weed management is essential to prevent competition for nutrients and moisture. Herbicides are commonly used for weed control in wheat.

      <h3 class="subHeading">Harvesting</h3>
      <h4 class="title">Timing  </h4>
      <p class="info">
        Wheat is harvested after 6-7 months from sowing, depending on the variety and growing conditions.
      </p>
      <h4 class="title">Method  </h4>
      <p class="info">
        After harvesting, wheat is threshed to separate the grains from the straw. It is then cleaned and stored.
