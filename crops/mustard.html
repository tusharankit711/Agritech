      <h3 class="subHeading">Temperature Requirements</h3>
      <h4 class="title">Minimum Temperature  </h4>
      <p class="info">
        Mustard requires a minimum temperature of around 10-15°C for germination.
      </p>
      <h4 class="title">Optimum Temperature  </h4>
      <p class="info">
        The ideal temperature range for mustard growth is 20-25°C during the vegetative stage. Cooler temperatures during flowering (15-20°C) promote better pod setting and seed development.

      <h3 class="subHeading">Rainfall</h3>
      <h4 class="title">Rainfall Requirements</h4>
      <p class="info">
        Mustard is relatively drought-tolerant but requires sufficient moisture for good growth.
      </p>
      <h4 class="title">Rainfed Areas  </h4>
      <p class="info">
        Mustard requires around 400-600 mm of well-distributed rainfall during the growing season.
      </p>
      <h4 class="title">Irrigated Areas  </h4>
      <p class="info">
        Proper irrigation management is crucial, especially during critical growth stages like flowering and pod formation.

      <h3 class="subHeading">Soil Requirements</h3>
      <h4 class="title">Soil Type</h4>
      <p class="info">
        Mustard grows well in well-drained loamy soils with good organic matter content.
      </p>
      <h4 class="title">Fertility</h4>
      <p class="info">
        Mustard requires moderate levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Fertilizer application should be based on soil testing and crop requirements.
      </p>
      <h4 class="title">Fertilizer</h4>
      <p class="info">
        Commonly used fertilizers for mustard include nitrogenous fertilizers (urea), phosphatic fertilizers (DAP), and potassic fertilizers (MOP). Nitrogen is crucial during the early growth stages, while phosphorus promotes root development and seed formation.

      <h3 class="subHeading">Cultivation Practices</h3>
      <h4 class="title">Land Preparation  </h4>
      <p class="info">
        Fields are plowed and harrowed to create a fine seedbed.
   - Sowing: Mustard seeds are sown directly into the soil at the appropriate depth and spacing.
      </p>
      <h4 class="title">Water Management</h4>
      <p class="info">
        Adequate and timely irrigation is crucial, especially during dry spells and critical growth stages.
      </p>
      <h4 class="title">Weed Control</h4>
      <p class="info">
        Effective weed management is essential to reduce competition for nutrients and water. Herbicides are commonly used for weed control in mustard fields.
      </p>
      <h4 class="title">Disease and Pest Management</h4>
      <p class="info">
        Common pests affecting mustard include aphids, flea beetles, and caterpillars. Diseases such as white rust and alternaria blight can also impact mustard crops. Integrated pest management practices and timely application of fungicides are essential for pest and disease control.
